Project to show the users' favourite YouTube videos

This is my version of the [members-only](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only) project from
The Odin Project. Users can show their favourite YouTube videos here with their comment. There are users with member status 
and there is the admin of the site. You can get the member status after registration with typing in the following password:

No, it's not going to be so easy for you:) If you visit my [fakebook](https://alexerdei73.github.io/fakebook) app, there is 
the latest post. All you need to know the name of that group, which is on the video. This is the member password with lowercase and dash between words. The thing is a bit tricky as it is the latest post now, but if other members post there they can confuse you, so try to find the right post there:) 

Registered users can make posts with videos, but they can't see, who created the other posts and when. 

Members can see, who created the posts and when and they can create anonym posts. 

The admin user is me. I think you won't be able to find out the admin password, although you can try to crack it:) The admin user can delete posts too.
